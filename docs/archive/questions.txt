Is "emit corrections" the best option?
   It depends on what downstream systems can handle. Let's compare:

   Option A: Emit Corrections (Complex but "Correct")

     10:01:00 → Emit candle v1: {open: 100, close: 102, ...}
     10:01:03 → Late tick arrives for 10:00:45
     10:01:03 → Emit candle v2: {open: 99, close: 102, ...}  ← CORRECTION

   Pros:

     - Most accurate
     - No data loss

   Cons:

     - Downstream must handle updates (not just inserts)
     - Databases need upsert logic
     - Dashboards might flicker
     - Trading models need to handle "candle changed after I made a decision"
     - Complexity explodes

   Option B: Accept Inaccuracy (Pragmatic)

   The key question: How much data is actually late?

     # Measure your actual disorder
     late_ticks = count(ticks where arrival_time - event_time > watermark)
     total_ticks = count(all ticks)
     late_rate = late_ticks / total_ticks

     # Typical results for well-designed systems:
     # - Same datacenter: 0.001% late (almost never)
     # - Cross-region: 0.1-1% late
     # - Unreliable vendor feed: 5-10% late

   If 0.1% of ticks are late, your candle is 99.9% accurate. For most trading signals, that's fine.

   When inaccuracy is NOT acceptable:

     - Regulatory reporting (must be exact)
     - P&L calculation (money is involved)
     - Audit trails

   When inaccuracy IS acceptable:

     - Real-time dashboards (humans won't notice)
     - Trading signals (speed > perfect accuracy)
     - Anomaly detection (approximate is fine)
